# Introduction

This document provides an overview of the MAO Admin Panel project, a comprehensive solution for managing restaurant staff. This project was developed as a qualifying work for the confirmation of the degree of a professional junior bachelor.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly admin panel that simplifies staff management for the MAO restaurant. The system aims to automate and streamline key HR processes, from tracking attendance to managing tasks and payroll adjustments.

## Thesis Objectives

The developed software product must provide the following functionality:

- **Tracking Work Shifts**: An interface for employees and managers to view and manage work schedules.
- **Assigning Tasks**: Functionality for managers to assign tasks to individual employees (personal tasks) or to all staff (global tasks).
- **Recording Tardiness**: An automated system to log late arrivals, helping to maintain discipline and track employee punctuality.
- **Rewards and Fines System**: A feature to manage bonuses and penalties, which can be tied to performance, tardiness, or other criteria. This system is crucial for transparently managing payroll adjustments.
